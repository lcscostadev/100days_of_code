                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                        language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                        the
                        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
                        of
                        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                        extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                            and
                            its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                            place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                            and
                            page navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                            JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                            communicate
                            with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                            application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

                        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked
                            on
                            the main page about JavaScript.

                    <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
                    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                        JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                        checking.
                        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                        constructs
                        which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                        runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                        values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based
                        object
                        model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can
                        vary
                        for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                        variables,
                        classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
                        or
                        protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function
                        return
                        types are not explicitly typed.

                    <h1>Hello world</h1>
                    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                        JavaScript code:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName);}  <br> greetMe("World");
                    </code>
                    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

            <section class="main-section Constants" id="Constants">
                <header>
                    <h1>Constants</h1>
                    <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                        identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                        dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                    </p>
                    <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                    <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running.
                        It
                        has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                    <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
                        keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                        example:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL <br>
        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
        } <br></code>
                    <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                        problems.</p>
                    <code>
        const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
        </code>
